Feature 5 / Citation Generator

Feature 5 is a button at the bottom of pages in the Riki site. Pages (articles) can be created and mimic articles in
wikipedia in their form and can be indexed by tags. Given this site's similarity to wikipedia, we can infer that users
may want to cite articles they find on the website for scholarly purposes. To assist them in this, we created a method
that generates two of the more popular formats of citations using variables already present in the code. 

When the user navigates to a page on the site, they can scroll to the bottom of the page to find a button labeled 
"View Citations". When they click on it, a pop up window appears with the MLA and APA citation printed out as well as a button
under each labelled either "Copy MLA" or "Copy APA" that will copy the citation to their clipboard.

The features was added by modifying page.html which is the html used for pages/articles. It contains metadata such as the title
and URL which are required. Then the publisher, Riki, is added, and we use formatDate() to get the time the article was 
accessed.
