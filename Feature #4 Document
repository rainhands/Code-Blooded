Feature 4 / Accessibility Feature

This feature adds a new button labelled "Accessibility" to the navbar of all of the pages. When clicked, this button 
creates a pop up window with two checkboxes: High Contrast and Large Text. When checked, the High Contrast mode turns
backgrounds to black and text yellow. This is a common type of accessibility feature designed for users that may struggle
to differentiate similar hues. The Large Text checkbox, when checked, increases text size by 50%, which is more drastic
than it may sound. This is intended for users that may not be able to see small text as well as others.

Feature 4 modifies base.html to add the button to the Navbar which is present on all pages. The logic for the high contrast
mode and large text is also embedded into this html for simplicity since they're rather small functions.
