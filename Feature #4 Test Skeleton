Requirements 5
- There should be a button on the navbar that, when clicked, opens a pop-up window.
- The pop-up window must contain two checkboxes: one for high contrast mode and one for larger text.
- When the high contrast mode checkbox is checked, the background color of the site should change to black and the text color should change to yellow.
- When the larger text checkbox is checked, the text size on the site should increase by 50%.
- The state of these checkboxes (whether they are checked or not) should be preserved across different pages of the site or after the page is reloaded.
Unit Tests 6
- Button Display Test: Test if the button is correctly rendered on the navbar.
- Pop-up Window Render Test: Test if the pop-up window is displayed when the button is clicked.
- Checkbox Render Test: Test if both checkboxes are present in the pop-up window.
- High Contrast Mode Toggle Test: Test if the background and text color change when the high contrast checkbox is toggled.
- Larger Text Mode Toggle Test: Test if the text size increases by 50% when the larger text checkbox is toggled.
- State Preservation Test: Test if the state of the checkboxes is saved and correctly applied when the page is refreshed or navigated.
Integration Tests 1
- Interaction Test: Test the interaction between the checkbox state and the display settings to ensure changes are applied site-wide.
Regression Tests 3
- Navbar Functionality Test: Ensure that existing navbar functions are not compromised by the addition of the new button.
- Style and Layout Test: Ensure that the site's layout, styles, and other color themes are not adversely affected by the high contrast mode.
- Text Resizing Test: Confirm that all programmed text elements on the site correctly resize when the larger text option is enabled.
Acceptance Tests 2
- User Experience Test: Have users interact with the feature to confirm it meets their expectations and the requirements.
- Responsive Design Test: Check that the feature is responsive and works well on different devices, including mobiles and tablets.
